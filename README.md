# Course Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a Course Recommendation System that uses a dataset of Udemy courses. The goal of this system is to recommend courses to users based on their preferences and interests.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following parameters:
1. `course_id`: The unique identifier for each course.
2. `course_title`: The title of the course.
3. `url`: The URL where the course can be accessed.
4. `is_paid`: Whether the course requires payment.
5. `price`: The price of the course.
6. `num_subscribers`: The number of subscribers for the course.
7. `num_reviews`: The number of reviews for the course.
8. `num_lectures`: The number of lectures in the course.
9. `level`: The level of difficulty of the course (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert).
10. `content_duration`: The duration of the course content.
11. `published_timestamp`: The date and time when the course was published.
12. `subject`: The subject of the course.

## Methodology
The project uses these parameters to build a recommender system that suggests courses to users based on their preferences. The system uses techniques such as text processing and cosine similarity to find courses that are most similar to the user's preferences.

## Usage
This project can be used by anyone looking to find courses on Udemy that match their interests and preferences. It can also be used by educational institutions or online learning platforms to recommend courses to their users.

## Future Work
Future work on this project could include refining the recommendation algorithm with more data, incorporating user feedback into the recommendations, and testing other recommendation algorithms for better accuracy.
